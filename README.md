# Pneumonia Detection

The project aims to develop a robust pneumonia detection system leveraging machine learning techniques, primarily utilizing Python libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Streamlit within a Jupyter environment. This project was developed for a hackathon hosted at SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRM IST) in Chennai, where it secured the 2nd prize and a reward of 10,000 INR. By harnessing a dataset sourced from platforms like Kaggle, comprising chest X-ray images annotated with pneumonia cases, the model is trained to accurately identify indicators of pneumonia. Through advanced image processing techniques facilitated by OpenCV, the system preprocesses and extracts relevant features from the X-ray images. TensorFlow serves as the backbone for constructing and training deep learning models, allowing for the creation of sophisticated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) adept at recognizing patterns indicative of pneumonia. Streamlit facilitates the deployment of the trained model into a user-friendly web application, enabling seamless interaction and inference. This project amalgamates cutting-edge machine learning methodologies with Python's versatility, offering a valuable tool for assisting medical professionals in diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-ray imagery efficiently and accurately.
